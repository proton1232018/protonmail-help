  <p>When submitting a ticket, it‚Äôs essential to provide detailed information about your issue, including screenshots if applicable. This helps ProtonMail customer care to diagnose and address your problem more effectively.</p>

  <h3>3. ProtonMail Social Media Channels</h3>
  <p>ProtonMail maintains an active presence on various social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. While these platforms are not primary support channels, you can often get updates on service status or announcements there.
